 * For even n : a^12 = a^1100 = a^8 * a^4 * a^0 * a^0   = a^8 * a^4
 * For odd  n : a^13 = a^1101  = a^8 * a^4 * a^0 * a^1  = a^8 * a^4 * a^1
 * 
 * Since the number n has exactly ⌊log2n⌋+1 digits in base 2. So we only need to 
 * perform O(logn) multiplications, if we know the powers a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, …, a⌊logn⌋
 * 
 * Now, we only need to know a fast way to compute the power in sequence. This is easy to do
 * as element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.

 *   a^n  = (a^n/2)^2;  if n is even and greater than zero
 *   a^n  = (a^(n-1)/2)^2 * a ;   if n is odd and greater than zero
 *
 *   Note : Integer division for odd n/2 is same as (n-1)/2
